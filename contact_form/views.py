        # (but not in Django 1.8).
        #
        # The longer explanation is that in Django 1.9,
        # FormMixin.form_invalid() does not pass the form instance to
        # get_context_data(). This causes get_context_data() to
        # construct a new form instance with the same data in order to
        # put it into the template context, and then any access to
        # that form's ``errors`` or ``cleaned_data`` runs that form
        # instance's validation. The end result is that validation
        # gets run twice on an invalid form submission, which is
        # undesirable for performance reasons.
        #
        # Manually implementing this method, and passing the form
        # instance to get_context_data(), solves this issue (which was
        # fixed in Django 1.9.1 and will not be present in Django
