Frequently asked questions
==========================

The following notes answer some common questions, and may be useful to
you when installing, configuring or using django-contact-form.


What versions of Django and Python are supported?
-------------------------------------------------

As of django-contact-form |version|, Django 1.8, 1.9, 1.10, and 1.11 are
supported, on Python 2.7, 3.3, 3.4, 3.5 or 3.6. Although Django 1.8
supported Python 3.2 at initial release, Python 3.2 is now at its
end-of-life and django-contact-form no longer supports it.

It is expected that django-contact-form |version| will also work
without modification on Python 3.6 once it is released.


What license is django-contact-form under?
----------------------------------------------

django-contact-form is offered under a three-clause BSD-style
license; this is `an OSI-approved open-source license
<http://www.opensource.org/licenses/bsd-license.php>`_, and allows you
a large degree of freedom in modifiying and redistributing the
code. For the full terms, see the file ``LICENSE`` which came with
your copy of django-contact-form; if you did not receive a copy of
this file, you can view it online at
<https://github.com/ubernostrum/django-contact-form/blob/master/LICENSE>.


Why aren't there any default templates I can use?
-------------------------------------------------

Usable default templates, for an application designed to be widely
reused, are essentially impossible to produce; variations in site
design, block structure, etc. cannot be reliably accounted for. As
such, django-contact-form provides bare-bones (i.e., containing no
HTML structure whatsoever) templates in its source distribution to
enable running tests, and otherwise simply provides good documentation
of all required templates and the context made available to them.


What happened to the spam-filtering form in previous versions?
--------------------------------------------------------------

Older versions of django-contact-form shipped a subclass of
:class:`~contact_form.forms.ContactForm` which used `the Akismet web
service <http://akismet.com/>`_ to identify and reject spam
submissions.

Unfortunately, the Akismet Python library -- required in order to use
such a class -- does not currently support all versions of Python on
which django-contact-form is supported, meaning it cannot be
included in django-contact-form by default. The author of
django-contact-form is working on producing a version of the
Akismet library compatible with Python 3, but it was not yet ready as
of the release of django-contact-form |version|.


Why am I getting a bunch of ``BadHeaderError`` exceptions?
----------------------------------------------------------

Most likely, you have an error in your
:class:`~contact_form.forms.ContactForm` subclass. Specifically, one
or more of :attr:`~contact_form.forms.ContactForm.from_email`,
:attr:`~contact_form.forms.ContactForm.recipient_list` or
:meth:`~contact_form.forms.ContactForm.subject` are returning values
which contain newlines.

As a security precaution against email header injection attacks (which
allow spammers and other malicious users to manipulate email and
potentially cause automated systems to send mail to unintended
recipients), `Django's email-sending framework does not permit
newlines in message headers
<https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/email/#preventing-header-injection>`_. ``BadHeaderError``
is the exception Django raises when a newline is detected in a header.

Note that this only applies to the headers of an email message; the
message body can (and usually does) contain newlines.


I found a bug or want to make an improvement!
---------------------------------------------

The canonical development repository for django-contact-form is
online at <https://github.com/ubernostrum/django-contact-form>. Issues
and pull requests can both be filed there.

If you'd like to contribute to django-contact-form, that's great!
Just please remember that pull requests should include tests and
documentation for any changes made, and that following `PEP 8
<https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/>`_ is mandatory. Pull
requests without documentation won't be merged, and PEP 8 style
violations or test coverage below 100% are both configured to break
the build.
