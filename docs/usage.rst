.. _usage:

Usage guide
===========

First you'll need to have Django and ``django-contact-form`` installed. For details
on that, see :ref:`the installation guide <install>`.

Once that's done, you can start setting up django-contact-form. Add
``"django_contact_form"`` to your :setting:`INSTALLED_APPS` setting. Then, you
can begin configuring.


URL configuration
-----------------

The quickest way to set up the views in ``django-contact-form`` is to use the
provided URLconf, found at ``django_contact_form.urls``. You can include it
wherever you like in your site's URL configuration. For example, to have it
live at the URL ``/contact/``:

.. code-block:: python

    from django.urls import include, path


    urlpatterns = [
        # ... other URL patterns for your site ...
        path("contact/", include("django_contact_form.urls")),
    ]

If you'll be using a custom form class, you'll need to manually set up your
URLs so you can tell ``django-contact-form`` about your form class. For example:


.. code-block:: python

    from django.urls import include, path
    from django.views.generic import TemplateView

    from django_contact_form.views import ContactFormView

    from yourapp.forms import YourCustomFormClass


    urlpatterns = [
        # ... other URL patterns for your site ...
        path("contact/",
            ContactFormView.as_view(
                form_class=YourCustomFormClass
            ),
            name="django_contact_form"),
        path("contact/sent/",
            TemplateView.as_view(
                template_name="django_contact_form/contact_form_sent.html"
            ),
            name="django_contact_form_sent"),
    ]

.. important:: **Where to put custom forms and views**

   When writing a custom form class (or custom
   :class:`~django_contact_form.views.ContactFormView` subclass), **don't** put
   your custom code inside ``django-contact-form``. Instead, put your custom
   code in the appropriate place (a ``forms.py`` or ``views.py`` file) in a
   Django application you've written.


.. _default-templates:

Required templates
------------------

In the default configuration, ``django-contact-form`` requires the following
templates to exist:


``django_contact_form/contact_form.html``
`````````````````````````````````````````

This is used to display the contact form. It has a
:class:`~django.template.RequestContext` (so any context processors will be
applied), and also provides the form instance as the context variable ``form``.

``django_contact_form/contact_form_sent.html``
``````````````````````````````````````````````

This is used after a successful form submission, to let the user know their
message has been sent. It has a :class:`~django.template.RequestContext`, but
provides no additional context variables of its own.


``django_contact_form/contact_form.txt``
````````````````````````````````````````

Used to render the subject of the email. Will receive a
:class:`~django.template.RequestContext` with the following additional
variables:

``body``
    The message the user supplied.

``email``
    The email address the user supplied.

``name``
    The name the user supplied.

``site``
    The current site. Either a :class:`~django.contrib.sites.models.Site` or
    :class:`~django.contrib.sites.requests.RequestSite` instance, depending on
    whether `Django's sites framework
    <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.11/ref/contrib/sites/>`_ is
    installed).


``django_contact_form/contact_form_subject.txt``
````````````````````````````````````````````````

Used to render the subject of the email. Will receive a
:class:`~django.template.RequestContext` with the following additional
variables:

``body``
    The message the user supplied.

``email``
    The email address the user supplied.

``name``
    The name the user supplied.

``site``
    The current site. Either a :class:`~django.contrib.sites.models.Site` or
    :class:`~django.contrib.sites.requests.RequestSite` instance, depending on
    whether `Django's sites framework
    <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.11/ref/contrib/sites/>`_ is
    installed).

    .. warning:: **Subject must be a single line**

      In order to prevent `header injection attacks
      <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email_injection>`_, the subject *must* be
      only a single line of text, and Django's email framework will reject any
      attempt to send an email with a multi-line subject. So it's a good idea
      to ensure your ``contact_form_subject.txt`` template only produces a
      single line of output when rendered; as a precaution, however,
      ``django-contact-form`` will, by default, condense the output of this
      template to a single line.


Using a spam-filtering contact form
-----------------------------------

Spam filtering is a common desire for contact forms, due to the large amount of
spam they can attract. There is a spam-filtering contact form class included in
``django-contact-form``:
:class:`~django_contact_form.forms.AkismetContactForm`, which uses `the Akismet
spam-detection service <https://akismet.com/>`_.

To use this form, you will need to do the following things:

1. Install `the Python akismet client <https://akismet.readthedocs.io/>`_ to
   allow ``django-contact-form`` to communicate with the Akismet service. You
   can do this manually (in which case you must install at least version 24.5.0
   of ``akismet``) or as you install ``django-contact-form`` by telling ``pip``
   to install ``"django-contact-form[akismet]"``.

2. Obtain an Akismet API key from <https://akismet.com/>, and associate it with
   the URL of your site.

3. Supply the API key and URL for ``django-contact-form`` to use. You can
   either place them in the environment variables ``PYTHON_AKISMET_API_KEY``
   and ``PYTHON_AKISMET_BLOG_URL``.

Then you can replace the suggested URLconf above with the following:

.. code-block:: python

    from django.urls import include, path


    urlpatterns = [
        # ... other URL patterns for your site ...
        path("contact/", include("django_contact_form.akismet_urls")),
    ]
