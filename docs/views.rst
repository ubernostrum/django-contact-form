Built-in views
==============

.. class:: ContactFormView

    The base view class from which most custom contact-form views
    should inherit. If you don't need any custom functionality, and
    are content with the default
    :class:`~contact_form.forms.ContactForm` class, you can also just
    use it as-is (and the provided URLConf, ``contact_form.urls``,
    does exactly this).

    This is a subclass of `Django's FormView
    <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/class-based-views/flattened-index/#formview>`_,
    so refer to the Django documentation for a list of
    attributes/methods which can be overridden to customize behavior.

    One non-standard attribute is defined here:

    .. attribute:: recipient_list

       The list of email addresses to send mail to. If not specified,
       defaults to the
       :attr:`~contact_form.forms.ContactForm.recipient_list` of the
       form.

    Additionally, the following standard (from ``FormView``) methods
    and attributes are commonly useful to override (all attributes
    below can also be passed to ``as_view()`` in the URLconf,
    permitting customization without the need to write a full custom
    subclass of ``ContactFormView``):

    .. attribute:: form_class

       The form class to use. By default, will be
       :class:`~contact_form.forms.ContactForm`. This can also be
       overridden as a method named ``form_class()``; this permits,
       for example, per-request customization (by inspecting
       attributes of ``self.request``).

    .. attribute:: template_name

       The template to use when rendering the form. By default, will
       be ``contact_form/contact_form.html``.

    .. method:: get_success_url()

       The URL to redirect to after successful form submission. By
       default, this is the named URL ``contact_form.sent``. In the
       default URLconf provided with django-contact-form, that URL
       is mapped to ``TemplateView`` rendering the template
       ``contact_form/contact_form_sent.html``.

    .. method:: get_form_kwargs()

       Returns additional keyword arguments (as a dictionary) to pass
       to the form class on initialization.

       By default, this will return a dictionary containing the
       current ``HttpRequest`` (as the key ``request``) and, if
       :attr:`~ContactFormView.recipient_list` was defined, its value
       (as the key ``recipient_list``).

       .. warning:: If you override ``get_form_kwargs()``, you
          **must** ensure that, at the very least, the keyword
          argument ``request`` is still provided, or ``ContactForm``
          initialization will raise ``TypeError``. The simplest
          approach is to use ``super()`` to call the base
          implementation in ``ContactFormView``, and modify the
          dictionary it returns.
