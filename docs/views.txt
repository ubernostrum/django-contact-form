Included views
==============


One view is included with this application:
``contact_form.views.contact_form``, which knows how to work with
``contact_form.forms.ContactForm`` and its subclasses, and takes
several useful keyword arguments for specifying behavior.


``contact_form.views.contact_form``
====================================

Render a contact form, validate its input and send an email from it.

**Optional arguments:**

``fail_silently``
    If ``True``, errors when sending the email will be silently
    supressed (i.e., with no logging or reporting of any such
    errors. Default value is ``False``.

``form_class``
    The form to use. If not supplied, this will default to
    ``contact_form.forms.ContactForm``. If supplied, the form class
    must implement a method named ``save()`` which sends the email
    from the form; the form class must accept an ``HttpRequest`` as
    the keyword argument ``request`` to its constructor, and it must
    implement a method named ``save()`` which sends the email and
    which accepts the keyword argument ``fail_silently``.

``success_url``
    The URL to redirect to after a successful submission. If not
    supplied, this will be the URL pointed to by the named URL pattern
    ``contact_form_sent``.

``template_name``
    The template to use for rendering the contact form. If not
    supplied, defaults to :template:`contact_form/contact_form.html`.

**Context:**

``form``
    The form instance.
    
**Template:**

The value of the ``template_name`` keyword argument, or
:template:`contact_form/contact_form.html`.
